This makes it extremely difficult to test that your filtering actually works, which is becoming ever more important with recent safety changes. <strong>Team Test, however, has the real, honest to God text filter.</strong> You don't need to actually have anyone else, your place just needs to support Team Create.</p>\n<p>This is because Team Create really does spin up a real Roblox server. In fact, it's sometimes faster to use Team Test than it is to use Play Solo if you have a large place, just because your computer doesn't have to load the whole thing.</p>\n<img src=\"/article-assets/psa-team-test-filters-text/demo.png\" width=\"100%\">","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2026-01-27","title":"PSA: Team Test filters text"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/psa-team-test-filters-text/"}},
